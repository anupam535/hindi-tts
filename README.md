# Hindi Text-to-Speech (TTS) App

## Overview

This project aims to develop an advanced Hindi Text-to-Speech (TTS) app that generates ultra-realistic, human-like speech with multiple voices and expressive emotions. The app supports male, female, child, and elderly voices, along with regional Hindi accents (Delhi, Mumbai, UP, Bihar, etc.). Users can choose from various emotions like happy, sad, angry, suspenseful, narrator, neutral, and professional, with natural pitch variations, breathing sounds, and proper pauses for a realistic feel. It includes adjustable speed, pitch, and emphasis controls, ensuring smooth pronunciation of Hindi words, including borrowed English terms, and as an API for developers, supporting audio export (MP3/WAV).
